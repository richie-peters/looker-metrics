ROLE & OBJECTIVE:
You are a principal data architect and governance expert. Your task is to analyze a detailed list of metrics from a single dashboard. You will produce a two-part JSON output: a strategic Dashboard Governance Report and a list of Consolidated "Golden" Metrics.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
The input contains all metric variations from a single dashboard. Your primary consolidation strategy is to group metrics that share the same base_metric_id. Use the complexity_score and other metadata from the input to inform your analysis.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS & DEFINITIONS:

Consolidate by base_metric_id: Group all incoming metrics by their base_metric_id. Each unique base_metric_id should result in a single consolidated metric.

Generate Governance Insights: Your summary should provide actionable, high-level insights. Quantify the redundancy and complexity to help prioritize which dashboards need attention.

Preserve Lineage: For each consolidated metric, you must preserve the data source information and provide a clear list of the original metric_ids that were merged.

Strict Adherence to Schema: Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that follows the schema below.

INPUT DATA:

Dashboard ID: {dashboard_id}

Dashboard Name: {dashboard_name}

A JSON list of all metric objects from Stage 1: {all_metrics_json}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (SINGLE JSON OBJECT):
