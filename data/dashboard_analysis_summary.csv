Specifically, it monitors the 'Total Daily Target by Section Team', suggesting its purpose is to provide an overview of operational or sales targets, broken down by specific teams or sections within an organization. It likely serves as a key performance indicator (KPI) dashboard for managing and assessing daily goal attainment at a localized or specific version (2.0) level.",1,1,1,"This dashboard currently contains only one metric. As such, there are no immediate governance issues related to metric duplication, inconsistent naming, or overly complex logic within the dashboard itself. However, a significant governance observation is the lack of explicit source table information (GCP project, dataset, table name) within the provided metric metadata. The 'metric_sql_core' uses an alias 't0' without defining its underlying table, which is a critical gap for data lineage, understanding, and maintainability. For future scalability and robust data governance, it is crucial to include comprehensive metadata for all source tables."

The dashboard aims to provide insights into user engagement and the volume of test-related activities within the Verity 2.0 ecosystem.",3,2,1,"This dashboard exhibits a low level of metric complexity, with all metrics relying on a simple 'COUNT(1)' core SQL logic. A significant governance concern is the highly generic nature of the 'metric_sql_core', which implies that critical filtering and contextual logic (e.g., 'User & Page Filtered' vs. 'Page Filtered') is applied externally to the metric definition. This externalization can lead to inconsistencies, difficulty in auditing, and a lack of transparency regarding the exact data being counted. Additionally, the presence of very similar metric names ('GA Event Count (User & Page Filtered)' and 'GA Event Count (Page Filtered)') highlights a need for clearer naming conventions and consolidation to reduce redundancy and improve metric discoverability. The absence of explicit source table metadata within the provided metric definitions is also a governance gap, hindering data lineage and impact analysis."

It aims to track progress against established daily goals, potentially for content publication or similar operational metrics.",2,1,1,"This dashboard exhibits a clear governance issue related to metric definition and naming. Two distinct metrics are defined with identical underlying SQL logic (`SUM(t0.day_target_by_publication_group)`), differing only in their names, with one explicitly indicating a 'RegEx Filtered' application. This suggests that filtering logic, which should ideally be applied at the reporting layer, has led to the creation of redundant core metrics. This practice increases maintenance overhead, introduces potential for inconsistency, and obscures the true 'golden' definition of the metric. Furthermore, critical metadata such as the source GCP project, dataset, and table for 't0' are missing from the provided metric definitions, hindering proper data lineage and governance."
d8104888-c324-42d8-a9b1-c065ba1c8622,NQ Cost Operation Dashboard Non-Prod,"This dashboard is designed to monitor and manage operational costs specifically related to BigQuery development activities within a non-production environment. It provides insights into the financial expenditure associated with development resources, enabling teams to track and optimize spending.",1,1,1,"Based on the single metric provided, the dashboard's purpose is clear and the metric's calculation is straightforward. However, with only one metric, it is not possible to identify patterns of naming inconsistencies, redundant calculations, or other common governance issues that typically arise in larger dashboards. A key piece of metadata, the `source_tables` information, was not provided for the metric, which is crucial for complete data lineage and governance."

It provides counts of various registration types and sums of daily subscription targets, suggesting its purpose is to monitor daily progress against business goals in these areas.",5,2,3,"This dashboard exhibits significant metric redundancy, with multiple metrics sharing identical core SQL logic (`COUNT(1)` and `SUM(t0.day_target_by_section_team)`). This indicates a lack of standardized metric definitions, leading to proliferation of similar metrics that likely differ only by dashboard-level filtering or grouping. This approach increases maintenance overhead and the risk of inconsistent reporting. There's also an inconsistency in metric naming specificity, which could lead to confusion regarding their exact scope without deeper investigation into dashboard filters."
52b2e0a6-fd53-4788-94da-101037302104,Data Townhall Feedback,"This dashboard is designed to track engagement or participation in 'Data Townhall' events by counting the number of unique contacts involved. It likely serves to measure audience reach or attendance for feedback sessions, providing insights into the distinct individuals who have interacted or provided input.",2,1,1,"This dashboard exhibits a significant governance issue related to metric redundancy and inconsistent naming. Two distinct metrics (`Unique Contacts Count (Alias 1)` and `Unique Contacts Count (Alias 2)`) are defined with identical underlying SQL logic (`COUNT(DISTINCT t0.contact_id)`). This indicates a lack of a centralized metric catalog or enforcement of naming conventions, leading to duplication, potential confusion, and increased maintenance overhead. Standardization of metric definitions and naming is highly recommended to improve data governance and reliability."
4114bd43-f752-4628-9b6c-1941b3c0d962,FY26 Campaigns Report (Sandbox),"This dashboard, despite being named for FY26, primarily focuses on reporting gross revenue from digital campaigns for fiscal years 2024-2025. It includes metrics for tracking revenue performance, financial period context, and data freshness. Its 'sandbox' designation suggests it might be under development or used for testing new reporting capabilities.",4,3,2,"This dashboard exhibits a clear governance issue with duplicate metrics. Specifically, 'Gross Revenue Sum (Digital, FY24-25, Filtered Ad/Pub Types)' and its 'Alt Alias' counterpart are identical in their core SQL logic but have different names and IDs. This redundancy can lead to confusion, inconsistent reporting, and increased maintenance overhead. Additionally, the dashboard name 'FY26 Campaigns Report' conflicts with the FY24-25 scope indicated in the metric names, suggesting a potential misalignment or a need for clearer versioning/scoping."
d7dcf866-1b93-48f8-a0c3-56c743029896,Digital Campaign Performance - Data Validation,"This dashboard is designed to monitor and validate key performance indicators (KPIs) for digital marketing campaigns. It tracks essential metrics such as campaign spend, impression counts, link clicks, and subscription conversions, while also highlighting data quality issues like 'breach counts'. The 'Data Validation' in its name suggests its primary use is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of campaign performance data, identifying potential anomalies or inconsistencies.",7,5,3,"This dashboard exhibits clear governance issues, primarily metric duplication and inconsistent naming conventions. Two core metrics, 'Total Impression Count' and 'Total Breach Count', have redundant entries with 'Variation 2' suffixes, despite having identical underlying SQL logic. This redundancy can lead to confusion among users, inconsistent reporting, and increased maintenance overhead. It highlights a critical need for standardized metric definitions, a centralized metric catalog, and a robust process for deprecating or consolidating redundant metrics to improve data governance and reliability."

While the dashboard name suggests tracking weekly subscriptions, the provided metrics primarily focus on the aggregated C-Score targets, potentially broken down by different dimensions like publication groups in the visualization layer.",2,1,1,"This dashboard exhibits a clear opportunity for metric consolidation. Multiple metrics (`Total C-Score Target for Messenger`, `Total C-Score Target by Publication Group`) share identical underlying SQL logic (`SUM(t0.c_score_target)`), indicating redundancy and a lack of a standardized 'golden' metric definition. This leads to potential inconsistencies in reporting and increased maintenance overhead. Consolidating these into a single 'Total C-Score Target' metric will improve data governance, ensure consistency, and simplify future development."
bedebbe4-3e46-47d5-bc36-6d867544ba66,News Incident Report,"This dashboard provides a critical overview of incident management performance, likely for a news organization's operational systems. It tracks key metrics related to the volume of incidents, and crucially, assesses the adherence to service level agreements (SLAs) by categorizing incidents based on whether their initial response and final resolution targets were achieved or breached. This allows stakeholders to monitor operational efficiency and identify areas for improvement in incident handling.",6,6,6,"This dashboard presents significant governance challenges primarily due to the ambiguity and incompleteness of the 'metric_sql_core' definitions for several key performance indicators. Specifically, metrics like 'Responce_Achived' and 'Resolution_Breached' all share a generic 'COUNT(number)' SQL core. This implies that the critical filtering logic (e.g., 'WHERE response_status = 'Achieved'') is either missing from the metric definition itself or is handled externally, leading to a lack of transparency, potential for misinterpretation, and difficulty in auditing or replicating calculations. Furthermore, there are minor naming inconsistencies, such as the 'Responce' typo and mixed casing ('INC_MONTH' vs. 'total_incident'), which could be standardized for improved clarity and maintainability. The current setup heavily relies on tribal knowledge to fully understand the true calculation logic for several metrics, posing a significant risk to data integrity and trust."
b80779c9-a393-4f32-adc1-605745ac8957,Verity 2.0 - Active Paid Closing Base - Engagement and Demographic Deep Dive - DRAFT,"This dashboard is designed for an in-depth analysis of the active paid subscriber base. Its primary purpose is to provide insights into subscriber engagement levels, demographic characteristics, and key movements within the subscription lifecycle, such as acquisitions. The 'DRAFT' status indicates that this dashboard is currently under development and refinement.",3,2,3,"This dashboard exhibits several governance challenges. Firstly, there is clear metric redundancy, with two distinct metric names ('Active Subscription Count (CS Masthead)' and 'Active Paid Subscription Count by Engagement Level') sharing identical underlying SQL logic. This indicates a lack of a single source of truth for this core metric and potential for inconsistent reporting if definitions diverge in the future. Secondly, metric naming is inconsistent; one metric ('Acquisition Movement Count (Divided by 10)') embeds a presentation-layer calculation ('Divided by 10') directly into its name, which should ideally be handled at the visualization layer to maintain metric purity. Lastly, the provided metric data lacks explicit source table details (GCP project, dataset, table name beyond 't0' alias), which is critical for complete data lineage, impact analysis, and overall data governance."
c51835dc-61f0-4277-ab19-e374508dccd2,Last 6 months - highest subscriber usage,"This dashboard is designed to provide insights into subscriber engagement and activity over the most recent six-month period. It focuses on key usage metrics such as content consumption (article and page views), platform access (logins), and device usage patterns, likely to identify high-value subscribers or trends in subscriber behavior.",7,5,3,"This dashboard exhibits significant governance issues, primarily due to metric duplication. Multiple metrics ('Total Page Views' and 'Total Monthly Devices') are defined with identical underlying SQL logic but are presented as distinct entities, often differentiated only by arbitrary 'Query' suffixes. This indicates a lack of standardized metric definitions, inconsistent naming conventions, and potential for future data inconsistencies if the underlying logic were to diverge. It highlights a clear need for a centralized metric store and robust governance processes to ensure consistency and reduce analytical overhead."
c32d96e5-38f4-48a8-9b70-3d89a83f03aa,Circulation Insights,"The 'Circulation Insights' dashboard is designed to provide an aggregated view of financial or operational performance related to circulation activities. Based on the available metrics, its primary focus is on tracking the total 'Amount' (likely revenue or sales value) across different categories, such as 'Revenue Type 01' and 'Revenue Type 02', and for specific periods like 'Year 2025'. It aims to offer high-level summaries of key aggregated values within the circulation domain.",2,1,2,"This dashboard exhibits several governance challenges. Firstly, the underlying SQL logic for all metrics is identical and contains redundant `CASE WHEN` clauses that effectively simplify to a direct `SUM(t0.amount)`. This indicates inefficient SQL and a potential misunderstanding of the `CASE` statement's application. Secondly, there's a significant discrepancy between the metric names ('Aggregated Amount or Volume') and the actual SQL implementation, which consistently calculates only 'Amount'. This can lead to misinterpretation of data. Lastly, specific filtering criteria (e.g., 'Revenue Type 01', 'Year 2025') are embedded directly into metric names, leading to metric proliferation rather than leveraging dashboard filters or dimensions for dynamic analysis. This approach hinders scalability, reusability, and maintainability of the dashboard's metrics."
eb904391-4d82-4b02-9f99-5eef7336117f,Martini Dashboard,"The 'Martini Dashboard' appears to be focused on video consumption analytics, specifically tracking 'Video Media Starts'. Its primary purpose is to provide insights into video engagement, with a particular emphasis on content displayed in portrait orientation and, in some cases, filtered by specific content sources like 'News.com.au'. This dashboard likely serves to monitor the performance of video content based on display characteristics and origin.",4,2,2,"This dashboard exhibits significant governance challenges. The most critical issue is the presence of duplicate `metric_sql_core` definitions, each associated with inconsistent `metric_id` and `metric_name` combinations. Specifically, the same SQL logic is represented by different IDs and names, and conversely, the same ID is used for different SQL logic. This indicates a severe lack of a centralized, authoritative metric definition system, leading to redundancy, potential for inconsistent reporting, and increased maintenance overhead. The hardcoding of 'News.com.au' also suggests a lack of parameterization or dimension-driven filtering, which could hinder scalability and flexibility."
a6c0f7df-8da6-44dc-bf50-72a907020ebc,Cluster by Engagement Level & Tenure Groupings,"This dashboard is designed to provide analytical insights into customer engagement and subscription longevity. It segments and groups customers based on their engagement levels and the duration of their subscriptions (tenure). Key metrics focus on counting unique subscribers and subscriptions, as well as aggregating subscription tenure data to understand customer cohorts and their lifecycle within the service.",6,5,3,"This dashboard exhibits several governance challenges. There is a direct duplication of the 'Unique Subscribers' metric, indicating a lack of standardized metric definitions and potentially leading to confusion or redundant development efforts. Furthermore, the presence of a 'Sum of Subscription IDs' metric is highly unusual and suggests a potential misinterpretation of data utility or a data quality issue, as summing identifiers typically yields no business value. This highlights a critical need for a robust data governance framework to enforce metric standardization, eliminate redundancy, and ensure the business relevance and validity of all reported metrics."

It tracks fundamental engagement metrics such as the total number of emails sent, the total clicks within those emails, and the count of unique email opens, aiming to assess the effectiveness of re-engagement efforts.",7,3,4,"This dashboard exhibits significant data governance issues, primarily the presence of multiple identical metrics ('Total Sends') with the same underlying SQL logic, indicating redundancy and potential for inconsistency if logic were to diverge. The use of generic column names (`clmn2_`, `clmn3_`, `clmn4_`) instead of descriptive business terms hinders understandability and maintainability. Furthermore, critical metadata such as source table information is missing, which complicates data lineage tracking and impact analysis. These issues suggest a lack of standardized metric definitions and a need for robust data cataloging and metric governance processes."
a42a8045-0c60-4346-bfd2-6d2b5839ebec,Verity 2.0 NNN Weekly Performance Report,"This dashboard provides a weekly performance overview for 'Verity 2.0 NNN', focusing on key operational targets such as C-Score, daily targets for publication groups, and website-specific targets, alongside general event volume tracking. It aims to monitor progress against defined goals and provide insights into weekly performance trends.",5,5,2,"This dashboard exhibits a clear separation of concerns among its metrics, with distinct aggregation targets. The SQL logic is simple and direct, primarily involving basic aggregations (SUM, COUNT) and a date parsing function, indicating low complexity. There are no immediate signs of naming ambiguity or hardcoded logic within the provided `metric_sql_core` snippets. A key governance improvement area is the lack of explicit source table details (GCP project, dataset, table names) within the metric definitions, which currently only use aliases (t0, t0c0d1). Providing this metadata would significantly enhance data lineage, maintainability, and understanding of the underlying data model."
acf4223b-efb2-4a6e-961d-a2f5fe0e004e,Verity 2.0 - Daily Digital Retro - DT,"This dashboard provides a daily retrospective view of key digital performance indicators. It tracks customer acquisition ('Adds'), customer churn ('Cancels'), and the resulting 'Net Adds' to assess subscriber or user growth. Additionally, it includes a 'Day Target Website' metric, likely used to measure daily website performance against predefined goals. The inclusion of 'ISO Week Start Date' suggests support for weekly trend analysis.",5,5,7,"This dashboard exhibits several governance considerations. While metric names are generally clear, the underlying SQL for 'ISO Week Start Date' is overly complex and verbose, indicating a potential lack of standardized date handling functions or a need for simplification. The inclusion of a date dimension ('ISO Week Start Date') as a 'metric' blurs the distinction between facts and dimensions, which can lead to confusion in data modeling. Crucially, the source table's project, dataset, and name are not explicitly provided in the metric definitions (only an alias 't0' is used), hindering clear data lineage and impact analysis. This suggests a need for improved metadata capture and a more robust metric definition framework."

Its primary purpose is to track the volume of monitored events, identify successful or acceptable updates, and understand the variety of statuses encountered during these operations. It serves as a health check for critical data processes.",3,3,3,"This dashboard exhibits several governance opportunities. The use of 'Copy of Test' in the dashboard name suggests it may be a development or ad-hoc dashboard, lacking a formal naming convention. Metric names show slight inconsistencies (e.g., 'Table Updates' vs. 'Monitored Tables'). A significant governance concern is the ambiguous column name 'TABLE' used in COUNT functions, which likely represents a record identifier rather than an actual database table name, leading to potential misinterpretation. Furthermore, hardcoded status values ('Success', '', ' ') within the SQL logic for 'acceptable' statuses reduce maintainability and flexibility. Standardizing column names and externalizing lookup values would significantly improve data governance."

It appears to be designed to track and compare these core metrics across different fiscal periods, likely for financial and operational performance monitoring. The 'Draft v1' in the name suggests it is an early version under development.",4,2,2,"This dashboard exhibits a common anti-pattern where fiscal year filtering is hardcoded directly into the metric definitions. This leads to metric proliferation, as evidenced by four distinct metrics representing only two core business concepts (Sales and Traffic). This approach is not scalable, as new metrics would be required for each new fiscal year or reporting period. It also hinders flexibility, as users cannot easily change the reporting period without modifying the underlying metric definitions. The use of a generic alias 't0' for the source table also suggests a lack of explicit data source documentation within the metric definitions themselves, which could impede data lineage and understanding."

It also includes metrics related to the count and sum of financial month numbers, which may be intended for temporal analysis or data volume tracking, though their current formulation raises governance concerns.",3,3,7,"This dashboard exhibits several governance concerns. Firstly, the hardcoded `CASE WHEN` logic for mapping financial short month names to numbers is brittle and not scalable, requiring manual updates for any changes in financial calendar definitions. This logic should ideally be managed via a robust date dimension table. Secondly, the 'Sum of Financial Month Numbers' metric has highly questionable business utility and likely represents an anti-pattern, suggesting a strong need for re-evaluation or deprecation. Summing ordinal month numbers typically lacks meaningful business interpretation. Thirdly, unit conversions (e.g., dividing by 1000 for 'Thousands') are embedded directly in the SQL, which is generally better handled at the presentation layer or as a standardized derived column for consistency. Finally, the reliance on a generic alias 't0' without explicit table identification hinders data lineage and understanding."

Its primary purpose is to identify and quantify 'gaps' or differences in volume between News.com.au and other major news providers, enabling stakeholders to understand relative performance and potential areas for growth or concern.",8,7,6,"This dashboard exhibits significant governance challenges. The use of generic, non-descriptive column names (`clmn0_`, `clmn1_`, etc.) makes the underlying data model opaque and difficult to interpret without external documentation. A critical issue is the conflicting definition of `clmn0_`, which is used as a measure for 'Total ABC' (`SUM(clmn0_)`) but also appears as a standalone metric named 'Device Type' (`clmn0_`). This ambiguity creates a high risk of misinterpretation and data misuse. Furthermore, the lack of explicit source table information (GCP project, dataset, table) for the metrics hinders data lineage and auditability. Naming conventions for derived metrics are inconsistent, requiring standardization.

Both original metrics, 'Count of Production AI/ML Projects' and 'Count of Non-Production AI/ML Projects', share the exact same underlying SQL core logic (`COUNT(DISTINCT metadata.projectId)`). This indicates that the distinction between 'production' and 'non-production' is a dimension or attribute of a project, rather than a fundamentally different way of counting projects. The current approach leads to redundant metric definitions and can complicate future metric management and scalability. A more robust and scalable design would define a single base metric for 'Total Count of AI/ML Projects' and allow for filtering or grouping by a 'project_status' dimension."

It tracks total sales volume across various sales channels and mastheads, and includes metrics related to 'Year' and 'Week', likely for time-series analysis or identifying patterns over time. The 'Regression' in the name suggests its purpose might be to provide source data for statistical regression models or to analyze factors influencing sales.",6,3,5,"This dashboard exhibits several governance challenges. Firstly, there are multiple metrics (`Total Sales Volume by Sales Channel Level 5`, `Total Sales Volume by Sales Channel Level 4`, `Total Sales Volume by Masthead for 2025`) that share the exact same underlying `SUM(t0.Sales_volume)` logic, indicating a lack of metric standardization and potential redundancy. Secondly, the metric 'Total Sales Volume by Masthead for 2025' has a specific year in its name, but this filter is not reflected in its `metric_sql_core`, suggesting that critical filtering logic might be applied externally (e.g., dashboard filters) or is missing from the metric definition, leading to potential misinterpretation. Lastly, the metrics 'Sum of Year' and 'Sum of Week' perform `SUM` aggregations on temporal dimensions, which is an unusual calculation and likely lacks practical business utility, warranting a review of their intended purpose and correct aggregation method (e.g., `COUNT(DISTINCT Year)` or `MAX(Year)`)."

It tracks the total user base, net consumer additions/cancellations, and provides dimensional breakdowns by various mastheads, likely to assess platform performance and audience trends across different publications.",4,4,6,"This dashboard exhibits several areas for governance improvement. A primary concern is the reliance on generic column names (e.g., `clmn0_`, `clmn1_`, `clmn2_`, `clmn6_`) within the SQL logic, which significantly reduces readability, maintainability, and understanding without external documentation. Furthermore, the extensive use of hardcoded `CASE` statements for mapping masthead IDs and names introduces inflexibility; any changes to masthead definitions require direct SQL modification rather than data-driven updates. There's also a lack of clear distinction between quantitative metrics (counts, sums) and dimensional attributes (masthead mappings), which could lead to confusion in data interpretation and future metric development. Standardizing column names, externalizing lookup tables, and establishing clear metric type definitions are recommended."

Based on the metric names, its primary focus appears to be tracking 'Unique Standard Paid Subscribers' over specific periods and under various conditions (e.g., latest attempt, with/without gateway exclusions). The dashboard aims to provide insights into the active subscriber base, potentially to identify trends, assess the impact of payment failures, or support retention strategies.",5,1,7,"This dashboard exhibits significant data governance and definition challenges. All five source metrics share an identical, highly generic 'metric_sql_core' (`COUNT(DISTINCT clmn1_)`), despite their names implying distinct business logic (e.g., time windows, specific attempt types, or gateway exclusions). This indicates a critical disconnect where contextual filtering is either expected to be applied externally (e.g., via dashboard filters) or is entirely missing from the metric definition, leading to potential misinterpretation and inconsistent reporting. Furthermore, there is extensive duplication of metric names and a severe issue where a single 'metric_id' ('t0_qt_1adt537vgd') is associated with two different metric names, violating the principle of unique identification for metric definitions. The use of a generic column name ('clmn1_') further hinders clarity and maintainability. These issues collectively contribute to a high complexity score, not due to intricate SQL, but due to the significant effort required to understand, trust, and maintain the dashboard's underlying data definitions."

5d551155-3caa-466b-a1ef-01d0cfa95966,PTC - Topic Authority,"This dashboard, 'PTC - Topic Authority', is designed to measure the unique reach or engagement related to specific topics. Its primary focus is on quantifying the number of distinct contacts, likely indicating the audience size or influence within various subject areas.",3,1,1,"This dashboard exhibits significant metric duplication, with three identical 'Distinct Contacts' metrics. This redundancy indicates a lack of standardization and potential for maintenance issues, as any change would require updating multiple identical definitions. The use of a generic column name (`clmn0_`) also suggests a need for improved data lineage and semantic clarity within the underlying data model."
7ffe7054-679e-4e8f-bb3d-01c6e7799899,Engagement data - Audience Insights M&R + TA,"This dashboard provides key engagement metrics focused on audience insights, likely supporting Marketing & Retention (M&R) and Talent Acquisition (TA) initiatives. It tracks fundamental audience size (active subscribers) and daily activity (base movements) to understand user engagement and population dynamics within various segments (e.g., Consumer, Digital, AA Masthead).",2,2,1,"Based on the provided limited input, no explicit governance issues (e.g., hardcoded logic, ambiguous naming, or data quality flags) were present in the source metric definitions. The two metrics have distinct SQL core logic (SUM vs. COUNT) and represent different business concepts, therefore no consolidation was possible based on the underlying calculations. Source table information (project, dataset, table name) could not be inferred from the provided 'metric_sql_core' and would require additional metadata for complete lineage."
cb5ce22d-b196-49dc-9d7b-8db7ca1f1f4d,Performance Solutions - Fin Year,"This dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on financial outcomes and operational aspects for a specific financial year. It tracks total revenue, identifies the earliest financial reporting period, and quantifies the variety of advertising sizes used, offering insights into financial health and operational scope related to performance solutions.",3,3,3,"This dashboard presents a small, distinct set of performance-related metrics. While no direct logical redundancies were found for consolidation based on identical business logic, the exercise allowed for standardization of metric definitions and SQL. A key governance opportunity identified is the absence of explicit source table metadata (project, dataset, table name) beyond the 't0' alias, which hinders complete data lineage documentation. The use of `SAFE_CAST` for data type handling is a positive practice."
9c92f02-f13b-4c32-a400-90135fdff180,Verity 2.0 - TAUS Wealth Last Week,"This dashboard provides an overview of key performance indicators related to wealth registrations and subscription targets for 'The Australian' publication, focusing on the previous week's activity. It tracks the volume of new wealth registrations across various sources and monitors progress against defined subscription goals.",3,2,2,"This dashboard exhibits a minor governance issue related to metric naming and definition. Two metrics, 'Wealth Registrations (Australian/Global Syn/Dow Jones)' and 'Wealth Registrations (The Australian)', represent the same core business event ('Wealth Registrations') but are presented as separate metrics, likely due to implicit filtering. This indicates a need for standardizing core metric definitions and leveraging dimensional attributes for segmentation rather than creating distinct metrics. The generic 'COUNT(1)' SQL core for all metrics also suggests a lack of explicit table or filtering logic within the metric definition itself, which could lead to ambiguity regarding data sources and specific business rules."
70ed3b92-987b-479b-9ed7-d2903bd2787e,Monthly Invoicing Breakdown,"This dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of monthly invoicing activities. It primarily focuses on displaying core identifiers such as account and booking numbers, alongside operational metadata like data warehouse load timestamps and a static indicator for the calendar period. The dashboard appears to be designed for granular transactional review and data lineage visibility rather than high-level aggregated business insights.",4,4,1,"This dashboard exhibits critical governance issues, most notably the non-unique 'metric_id' ('clmn1_') being assigned to two distinct business concepts: 'Data Warehouse ASL Load Timestamp' and 'Booking Number'. This fundamental flaw in metric identification can lead to severe ambiguity, incorrect data mapping, and maintenance challenges. Additionally, the 'Calendar Period Indicator' metric relies on hardcoded logic, which limits its flexibility and dynamic period management capabilities. The dashboard's metrics are predominantly direct column references, indicating a lack of complex derived business metrics and a potential opportunity for richer analytical definitions."
4e74297f-bdb0-426c-9c82-d42067eef9ee,SEO Reporting Suite,"This dashboard is designed to provide fundamental insights into Search Engine Optimization (SEO) performance. It tracks key metrics such as total clicks and impressions, enabling users to monitor the visibility and engagement of their web content in search engine results.",2,2,1,"Based solely on the provided metrics, which are few and distinct, no immediate governance issues such as redundancy, ambiguous naming, or complex, non-standardized SQL logic are apparent. The metrics are straightforward aggregations. However, the lack of explicit source table information (project, dataset, table) in the input data is a governance gap that would typically need to be addressed for full lineage and data quality assessment."
c412242b-14aa-4045-84f0-b8c3b5594898,Missing PCSID deep dive,"This dashboard appears to be designed for an in-depth analysis of records, specifically focusing on the presence or absence of a Personal Customer Service ID (PCSID). It tracks the existence status of PCSIDs, provides various counts of records (potentially under different filtering contexts like app version or platform), and includes a cast of subscriber IDs for numerical analysis. The primary purpose is likely to identify and investigate records that are missing a PCSID, understand the scope of this issue, and potentially analyze related attributes like subscriber IDs or record counts by specific properties.",7,3,3,"This dashboard exhibits several significant governance issues. There is substantial redundancy, with multiple metrics sharing identical underlying SQL logic (`COUNT(1)` and `SAFE_CAST`) but being named differently. Critically, the same `metric_id` is associated with different `metric_name`s in two instances (`t0_qt_x771yikhud` and `t0c0d1__subscriber_id_src__dv0_Cast_DOUBLE`), indicating a severe lack of unique metric identification and naming standardization. Furthermore, generic core metrics like `COUNT(1)` are given highly specific, contextual names (e.g., 'Filtered App Version', 'Android CM Only'), suggesting that filtering logic might be embedded in the metric name rather than being handled by dashboard filters or query parameters, which limits reusability. Finally, the provided metric definitions lack explicit source table metadata (GCP project, dataset, table), relying solely on aliases, which hinders data lineage and understanding of data sources."
7af6d106-46fc-4721-8a0c-3da32bc27707,Cadets,"This dashboard appears to track fundamental counts related to user activity or system records, specifically focusing on Google Analytics events and user test records within a 'Verity' system. Its primary purpose is likely to provide high-level volumetric insights into these distinct operational areas.",2,2,1,"This dashboard contains two distinct business metrics ('GA Event Count', 'Verity User Test Record Count') that, despite having different business contexts, share the exact same generic `COUNT(1)` SQL logic. This indicates a potential for ambiguity as the SQL core does not specify the data source or filtering criteria, making it difficult to discern *what* is precisely being counted without relying solely on the metric name. For improved governance, it is recommended to embed more specific table references or filtering conditions within the `metric_sql_core` or to clearly define the source tables for each metric to enhance clarity and prevent misinterpretation."
9060d6e1-ee05-438a-9bae-b80814a5e065,Verity 2.0 - Network Syndication Performance yesterday,"The 'Verity 2.0 - Network Syndication Performance yesterday' dashboard is designed to monitor the operational performance of network syndication activities. Its primary focus, as indicated by the 'Ingestion Date (Adjusted)' metric, is on tracking the timing and processing of data ingested into the system, specifically for the previous day, with a built-in adjustment for timezone or reporting period alignment.",2,1,3,"This dashboard exhibits a significant governance issue: **metric duplication**. Two distinct metric IDs (`t0_qt_35zfjo6r3c` and `t0_qt_zuagcreq4c`) are defined with identical names ('Ingestion Date (Adjusted)') and precisely the same underlying SQL logic. This redundancy inflates the metric count, complicates maintenance, and indicates a lack of a single source of truth for metric definitions. Furthermore, the use of an unmapped alias `t0` in the SQL core without explicit table metadata hinders data lineage tracking and understanding of the precise data source. The hardcoded `INTERVAL 11 HOUR` for date adjustment, while potentially a valid business rule, should be clearly documented and considered for parameterization if it's subject to change."
783f341c-8660-4e90-bab8-9bc860119cf5,Deals Dashboard,"The Deals Dashboard provides an overview of financial performance, specifically focusing on net revenue generated from deals, segmented by standardized financial periods (Fiscal Year and Quarter). It aims to track and analyze revenue contributions over time.",2,2,2,"The provided metrics are distinct in their purpose (one dimension, one measure) and do not show immediate signs of redundancy or ambiguous naming within this small sample. The SQL logic is straightforward, involving basic aggregation and string manipulation. A notable governance gap is the lack of explicit source table details (GCP project, dataset, table) within the metric definitions, which hinders data lineage tracking and impact analysis."
40ca2397-e61c-42bd-874c-ea7be0681a4b,KTV Dashboard,"This dashboard primarily focuses on monitoring content consumption and user engagement, specifically for video and article content. It tracks key metrics such as content starts, time spent, and various types of page views, with a particular emphasis on subscriber activity for articles. The dashboard aims to provide insights into how users interact with different content types and the level of engagement from the subscriber base.",6,5,4,"This dashboard exhibits a common pattern of metric proliferation due to implicit filtering and a lack of parameterization. For instance, 'Total Video Content Starts' and 'Total Article Content Starts' both rely on `SUM(t0.content_starts)`, implying that content type filtering is handled externally rather than being part of a unified, dimension-aware metric. This approach leads to redundant metric definitions and potential inconsistencies if the underlying filtering context is not consistently applied. The `metric_sql_core` for most metrics only specifies the aggregation function, assuming the correct base table and filtering are provided elsewhere. This highlights a need for a more robust data model that supports dimensional breakdowns and a standardized metric catalog to improve maintainability and reduce redundancy."
404605d3-dac4-4af9-b43e-b7915ecd7125,Inflated App PVS investigation,"This dashboard is designed to investigate potential inflation or anomalies in application page views (PVS). It tracks the total number of page views and provides contextual data by also monitoring total comment events, likely to identify correlations or contributing factors to page view discrepancies.",2,2,1,"The primary governance concern identified is the absence of explicit source table information within the provided metric definitions. While the `COUNT(1)` logic is simple and appropriate for a total count, the lack of a specified table context for each metric (e.g., `FROM page_views_table`) could lead to ambiguity, misinterpretation, or difficulty in tracing data lineage. This highlights a need for more comprehensive metadata capture for each metric, including its definitive source table(s)."
7ab2395e-d246-4e16-b376-dd763ecefecb,Verity 2.0 Weekly DT reporter pack,"This dashboard serves as a weekly reporting tool for the Verity 2.0 system, providing fundamental volume metrics. It specifically tracks the count of records related to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) events and internal Verity user test activities. Its primary purpose is likely to offer a high-level overview of data ingestion and operational activity within the Verity ecosystem for data teams or product stakeholders.",3,2,1,"The dashboard exhibits a clear governance issue related to metric naming and redundancy. Specifically, 'GA4 Event Record Count' appears under two different aliases, indicating a lack of standardized naming conventions and potential for confusion. All metrics utilize the most basic 'COUNT(1)' SQL logic, which, while simple, implies a strong reliance on the underlying table context for meaning, which is not explicitly provided in the metric definitions. This simplicity results in a very low complexity score but highlights an opportunity for improved metadata management and clearer metric definitions."
6d3aa90f-e0e3-4462-9032-286b434adfe8,SWG - Subscription Volume,"This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Google Web subscription volumes. It tracks both active and offplatform subscriptions, likely offering insights into subscriber base growth, acquisition channels, and overall subscription performance, potentially segmented by dimensions such as masthead, rate plan, and date.",6,2,2,"This dashboard exhibits significant data governance challenges. Multiple distinct metric names are tied to the exact same underlying SQL logic, leading to redundancy and metric sprawl. More critically, the 'metric_id' (`t0_qt_u70hqfq6td`) is inconsistently used across metrics with different core SQL calculations (`active_subscription_count` vs. `offplatform_subscription_count`), rendering it unreliable as a unique identifier for metric definitions. This indicates a lack of standardization in metric definition and ID management, necessitating a robust data catalog and clear metric governance policies to ensure consistency and maintainability."

It displays various Active Directory user attributes such as email, name, role, access level, and team affiliations, alongside aggregated counts and sums related to user records and access levels. Its primary purpose appears to be user management, auditing, or demographic analysis for the Verity 2.0 platform.",16,14,4,"This dashboard exhibits significant governance challenges primarily due to the embedding of specific filter values (e.g., 'Charlie Hall', 'Social editor') directly within metric names. This practice leads to non-reusable metrics, potential data inconsistencies if filters change, and complicates maintenance. Furthermore, there's a lack of standardization for basic counts, with multiple COUNT(1) metrics differentiated only by implied context. A potential SQL typo ('t0_DefaultFacebookPages' instead of 't0.DefaultFacebookPages') also suggests a need for stricter code review and data quality checks. Overall, the dashboard requires a robust metric definition and naming convention overhaul to improve reusability, maintainability, and data integrity."
6575ef79-5264-4580-998a-8150e679f565,Verity 2.0 Sports Live Streams: Weekly Wrap (Click here to access the full report),"This dashboard, 'Verity 2.0 Sports Live Streams: Weekly Wrap', is designed to monitor and report on the aggregated daily targets for sports live streams. It provides a weekly summary, but the underlying metrics suggest the capability to view these targets across various time granularities, including weekly, quarterly, annual, and custom periods, likely to assess performance against set goals for different reporting cycles.",5,1,1,"This dashboard exhibits a significant governance issue related to metric definition and naming. All five listed metrics share identical underlying SQL logic (`SUM(t0.day_target_by_publication_group)`), yet they are presented as distinct metrics with names implying different time granularities (Weekly, Annual, Quarterly, Custom). This redundancy indicates a lack of standardized metric definitions and could lead to confusion, maintenance overhead, and inconsistent reporting if the underlying logic were to diverge in the future. The time context should ideally be handled by dashboard filters or query parameters rather than creating separate, identical metrics."
