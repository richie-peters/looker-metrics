Multiple metrics leverage identical or near-identical SQL logic, differing only by specific hardcoded filter values (e.g., advertisers, date ranges). The underlying data, as revealed by `structure_sql` and `business_rules_sql`, contains a much broader range of dimension values (e.g., 4266 unique advertisers vs. 1-3 hardcoded, 17 unique transaction types vs. 5 hardcoded) than are currently utilized or accounted for in the specific metric definitions. This indicates a high degree of hardcoding and duplication, leading to potential maintenance overhead and limited flexibility. While data freshness and revenue checks passed, the current implementation limits the dashboard's scalability and adaptability to evolving business needs.",0

A primary concern is the pervasive hardcoding of fiscal year (2025) and specific fiscal weeks (31, 38, or 26-31) directly within the SQL logic for almost all metrics (Budget, Actuals, Current Period, 6-Week Rolling). This design choice prevents the dashboard from dynamically reflecting the most current data, as evidenced by the `primary_analysis_sql` showing data available up to fiscal week 52 of 2025, while dashboard metrics are querying older, static weeks. This repetitive, hardcoded structure for numerous variations of base metrics (e.g., 'Always-on Digital Sales', 'Revenue Consumer') creates a substantial maintenance burden and indicates a critical need for refactoring towards a more dynamic and parameterized data model. Furthermore, an inconsistency in how '6-Week Rolling' metrics are derived, specifically for 'Failed Payment Volume', suggests potential data model or metric definition discrepancies.",1

A pervasive anti-pattern is the widespread duplication of complex `CASE` statements for deriving masthead groups and recognition types across numerous metrics. Several dimension metrics are hardcoded to return static values, limiting their dynamic utility. The 'Fiscal Week and Month Label' metric is also static due to a fixed date. While the `business_rules_sql` successfully retrieved sample data, the absence of data for `primary_analysis_sql`, `structure_sql`, and `validation_sql` suggests potential limitations in the analysis process or the underlying data model's introspection capabilities. The initial AI analysis's note about 'Total Digital Subscriptions' summing a week number appears to be an error, as the provided SQL correctly uses `COUNT(*)`.",2

Live data validation confirms the presence of expected data points for 'Total Revenue Net by Transaction Type Group' and 'Total Revenue Net by Product Type', and the 'SSP Date' dimension aligns with the 'rolling 60 day' concept. The dashboard's data freshness and revenue checks are passing. While the dashboard's complexity and consolidation scores are reasonable, the reliance on a hardcoded CASE statement for transaction type grouping, even if currently exhaustive for the 9 unique types found, introduces a maintainability risk. Overall, the dashboard is functional and validated, but has an opportunity for improved data governance through externalized mapping logic.",3

However, a deeper analysis of the individual metric definitions reveals significant opportunities for further consolidation and refactoring. Multiple metrics, particularly those calculating 'Gross Revenue' and 'Distinct Data Load Datetime', employ highly similar SQL logic with minor variations in hardcoded filter values (e.g., source systems, revenue types, GL codes, specific years/weeks). This pattern suggests that while the dashboard might be functionally consolidated from a user perspective, the underlying metric definitions are redundant and could benefit from parameterization or a more flexible data model. The `primary_analysis_sql` sample data confirms the presence of relevant data fields and transaction statuses, supporting the feasibility of more generalized metrics. The 'Sum of Financial Week' metric is noted as an 'unusual aggregation', indicating a potential area for business logic clarification.",4

However, a significant anti-pattern observed is the pervasive hardcoding of the fiscal year '2025' across multiple core measures and dimensions. This severely limits the dashboard's reusability for historical or future analysis without manual SQL modifications, indicating a high need for parameterization or dynamic date filtering. Additionally, the 'Publication Name' dimension relies on a large, complex CASE statement for mapping publication codes, which is a maintenance burden and points to the absence of a proper lookup table. The calculation of 'Total Route Volume' also exhibits redundant logic, re-evaluating CASE statements for each component instead of leveraging more efficient aggregation methods.",5

All primary account dimensions (`Adpoint Account`, `Genera Booking Account`, `Medium Rare Debtor Account`, `National Debtor Account`) are defined with a `LIMIT 1` clause. This design choice renders the dashboard largely ineffective for its stated 'mapping' purpose, as it can only ever display a single, arbitrary account ID at a time, rather than a comprehensive list or relationship view. Live data confirms the existence of tens of thousands of unique accounts across these systems, yet the current metric SQL prevents their proper display. Furthermore, the `business_rules_sql` provides a valuable insight: not all Adpoint accounts have a corresponding National Debtor account (54,006 out of 62,966), which is a key mapping detail the dashboard should highlight but cannot with its current structure. Addressing the `LIMIT 1` anti-pattern is a high-priority consolidation effort to unlock the dashboard's intended value.",7

While it effectively centralizes various financial details, the analysis reveals opportunities for improved data modeling and metric definition practices. Specifically, the dashboard utilizes hardcoded `CASE` statements for display/sorting logic ('Day of Week (Formatted)') and conditional categorization ('Revenue Type (with XTEND)'), which can hinder maintainability and scalability. Furthermore, the pattern of defining separate 'selected' metrics for financial/calendar years and current/sync portfolio names, while functional, leads to metric proliferation that could be consolidated using Looker Studio parameters to dynamically switch underlying columns. Live data validation confirms data freshness and presence, but the `primary_analysis_sql` sample shows numerous `NULL` values for many fields, warranting further investigation into data completeness or query scope. Crucially, the `structure_sql` output lacks essential metadata like min/max financial/calendar year ranges and unique advertiser counts, indicating potential issues with the data structure query itself or underlying data recognition.",9

The most critical finding is the pervasive use of hardcoded `CASE` statements for publication grouping and date calculations, which are repeated across numerous metrics. This leads to high maintenance overhead, potential for inconsistencies, and a lack of scalability. Furthermore, the `sql_execution_summary` indicates that no live data validation was performed (`status: no_data`), which means the actual impact of these coding practices on data accuracy or performance could not be verified. The presence of multiple 'alternative calculation' metrics with seemingly identical SQL logic suggests potential redundancy or an incomplete development process.

While the initial AI analysis assigned a high consolidation score (8), a deeper dive into the metric SQL logic reveals extensive duplication and hardcoded filtering. All primary financial metrics (Actual, Budget, Forecast) are nearly identical, differing only by the aggregated amount column and specific hardcoded filters for Fiscal Year (FY2025), Fiscal Week (Week 40), OS Level 4 ('Total Revenue', 'Total Expenses'), and L03 Publication Code ('News Media Publishing'). This pattern extends to more granular metrics, adding hardcoded OS Level 6 filters. The presence of two distinct fiscal year dimension metrics, differing only by a single week filter, further highlights redundancy. The `primary_analysis_sql` failing to return data is a critical observation, suggesting potential underlying issues or an incomplete analysis setup. The `structure_sql` indicates 3 unique `os_level_4` values, yet metrics only filter for 2, implying a potential data gap.",12

All primary measure metrics (Total Records, Acquisition Count, Free to Paid Conversions, 30-Day Reactivations, Switch Acquisitions) embed identical, extensive hardcoded `CASE` statement logic for key dimensions (Subscription Type, Masthead Categories, Acquisition Source, Business Segment). This logic is also duplicated in separate dimension metrics. The `acquisition_source_category` definition is particularly problematic, as it explicitly categorizes only a small fraction of the 5845 unique source codes, leading to significant data exclusion due to subsequent `IS NOT NULL` filtering. The `product_group_category` metric further exemplifies this issue with its overly complex, nested hardcoded logic. While validation checks indicate data existence, the `primary_analysis_sql` returning 'no_data' is a critical observation requiring immediate investigation, potentially masking deeper data retrieval issues or misconfigurations.",13

While core data freshness and revenue positivity checks pass, a critical anti-pattern was identified: a repeated, hardcoded `CASE` statement used to derive 'revenue_category' across numerous key metrics. Live data from the `business_rules_sql` reveals that over 5 million records (out of 8.7 million total) fall into an 'Other' revenue category, which is not explicitly mapped by the `CASE` statement's `WHEN` clauses, resulting in `NULL` values for 'revenue_category' in the metric SQL. This means a significant portion of gross revenue is either uncategorized or implicitly excluded from specific category-based metrics, leading to potentially incomplete or misleading financial reporting. The `primary_analysis_sql` sample data further corroborates this with `null` values for `revenue_category` alongside valid revenue figures.",16

A complex, identical filtering clause is repeated in nearly all metrics, leading to high maintenance overhead. More critically, a family of 12 'Gross Revenue' metrics (spanning various financial year offsets and revenue types) utilize almost identical, large nested subqueries, differing only by minor filter conditions. This pattern severely impacts efficiency and maintainability. Furthermore, a critical data availability mismatch was identified: metrics designed to report on past financial years (FY-1, FY-2) will likely return null or zero values, as the `structure_sql` indicates the underlying data only exists from financial year 2024 onwards. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between metric design and data reality. The failure of `primary_analysis_sql` and `business_rules_sql` to return data also warrants immediate investigation, as it could mask deeper issues or indicate misconfigurations.",19

This creates brittle, inefficient, and difficult-to-maintain SQL logic. Furthermore, hardcoded financial years ('2024', '2025') are used in several filters, which will quickly lead to outdated data representation, especially considering the `structure_sql` shows data up to '2027'. A critical logic error was identified in the 'Revenue Group Subtype (Digital - Case Insensitive)' metric, where a `LOWER()` function on a derived category is incorrectly compared to a simple string, likely resulting in no matches or unexpected behavior.

This static date will inevitably lead to outdated and incorrect results as the financial periods advance, especially when the live data context (e.g., financial year 2027 in `primary_analysis_sql` sample) moves beyond this point. The highly complex, nested CASE statements and hardcoded lists of `unified_publication_name` values within these conditional metrics also introduce substantial technical debt and maintenance challenges. Furthermore, the dashboard exhibits metric proliferation by defining separate 'raw' and 'in Thousands' versions for several key revenue metrics.

c560ed20-040d-4c6a-9c3f-ec8bce27d132,Xtend Details,medium,"The 'Xtend Details' dashboard effectively utilizes the `v_adsales_revenue_client` table for its advertising domain metrics, with core data freshness and gross revenue validated by live SQL execution. However, a significant anti-pattern of hardcoding specific calendar/financial years and advertiser names into individual metric definitions has led to considerable metric proliferation. This approach, while potentially simplifying individual chart creation, severely hinders dashboard maintainability and scalability. A critical data mismatch was identified in the 'Publication Name (202x FY)' metric, where the SQL filter '202' will incorrectly include all years from 2024-2028 based on available data, contradicting the stated business intent of 2020/2021. Furthermore, the 'Sum of Calendar Month Values' metric's business utility is explicitly flagged as unclear, indicating a potential misconfiguration.",36
a8fe6bb0-3cbf-4d6e-8838-fa6e6dce447f,Pacing Dashboard,high,"The 'Pacing Dashboard' exhibits significant anti-patterns in its metric definitions, particularly concerning date calculations and source filtering. The most critical issue is the pervasive use of a hardcoded future timestamp ('2025-05-12') within high-criticality revenue pacing metrics. This design choice renders these metrics static and requires manual updates, severely impacting the dashboard's maintainability and future accuracy. Furthermore, there's a pattern of duplicated logic for source filtering ('Kargo', 'Non-AdX') and similar financial period dimensions, indicating a lack of centralized, dynamic data modeling. While the underlying data (as seen in `primary_analysis_sql` and `structure_sql`) supports a broader range of sources and financial periods, the current metric definitions limit flexibility and increase complexity. The dashboard's complexity score of 8 is directly attributable to these granular, hardcoded metric definitions, suggesting a strong need for consolidation and abstraction.",37
87651b69-c43e-471f-9c4b-98df1208a844,Programmatic Sales Patches ,high,"The dashboard, 'Programmatic Sales Patches', exhibits a high degree of hardcoded filtering within its metric definitions, specifically for `Advertiser`, `TransactionType`, and `Date`. While the dashboard consolidates around a single underlying data source (`programmatic_cal_month`), the metric definitions themselves are highly specific and unparameterized. This contradicts the initial AI's high consolidation score (7), which likely refers to data source consolidation rather than metric reusability. This pattern leads to metric sprawl, increased maintenance overhead, and limits the dashboard's flexibility for dynamic analysis, indicating a high priority for metric consolidation and parameterization.",38
52c11c9c-052a-4e45-9cda-8fecd87d7964,Team Sales Performance - FY26 (Interim)(with Pluto Reporting Date),high,"The dashboard 'Team Sales Performance - FY26' has a high consolidation score at the dashboard level, bringing together 7 key sales metrics. However, a deep dive into the underlying SQL reveals significant opportunities for architectural consolidation and improved coding practices. All metrics are built upon a large, identical Common Table Expression (CTE) and a complex set of hardcoded business rules. While the `structure_sql` and `validation_sql` indicate data availability and freshness, the `primary_analysis_sql` failed, preventing deeper live data validation of specific metric calculations. The pervasive use of hardcoded lists and complex `CASE` statements across all metrics, particularly for publication and revenue type classifications, suggests a lack of a centralized, governed data model layer. This anti-pattern leads to high maintenance overhead, potential for inconsistencies, and reduced reusability of logic.",39
80ca81f3-0671-40ef-a0a9-825a1580ca1b,Team Sales Performance,high,"The 'Team Sales Performance' dashboard, while functional and passing basic data quality checks, exhibits several significant anti-patterns in its metric definitions. Key issues include hardcoded parameters that render intended dynamic behavior static (e.g., K-adjustment, 'dynamic' dimension), and overly complex, hardcoded filtering logic within metrics. These practices severely impact maintainability, reusability, and future scalability. The `primary_analysis_sql` successfully retrieves gross revenue data, validating the core metrics, but the underlying SQL for derived metrics reveals a strong need for architectural refactoring to improve data governance and flexibility.",40
6f1c8731-02da-464f-b146-bf2947860735,Programmatic Sales_NQ Data,high,"The dashboard 'Programmatic Sales_NQ Data' exhibits a high initial consolidation score due to its reliance on a single underlying data source (`programmatic_fin_month`). However, a deeper analysis of the metric SQL reveals significant anti-patterns that severely undermine actual consolidation and maintainability. Multiple metrics employ extensive hardcoding for various dimensions (e.g., 'PortfolioParentGroup', 'PortfolioChildGroup', 'TransactionType', 'Advertiser'). Critically, two key metrics share an identical, highly complex, and brittle `CASE` statement for financial month-to-calendar month conversion and hardcoded date filtering. This pervasive duplication and hardcoding of business logic within individual metric definitions will lead to substantial maintenance overhead and hinder future scalability, indicating a strong and immediate need for refactoring towards a more robust, parameterized, and consolidated data model.",41
e83da1de-4227-43e6-bcc6-73051c66914b,Ad Events Dashboard,high,"The 'Ad Events Dashboard' exhibits a high consolidation score (8), suggesting consistent data sources (`v_adsales_revenue_client`) and filtering (`relative_fy_year_offset`) across its 8 metrics. However, a critical inconsistency exists: the `primary_analysis_sql` sample data shows `total_gross_revenue` as either 0.0 or null, and `total_net_revenue` as consistently null. This directly contradicts the `validation_sql` which reports a 'PASS' for `gross_revenue_check`. This discrepancy in core revenue metrics poses a significant risk to data reliability and dashboard trustworthiness. Additionally, the dashboard's ad type classification relies on hardcoded `CASE` statements with `REGEXP_CONTAINS`, an anti-pattern that hinders maintainability and scalability, especially as one of the defined categories ('Sponsorship') is not observed in the provided sample data.",42
e9d8a216-4950-4d30-b344-5011776edbdf,Adex Report,high,"The 'Adex Report' dashboard, while seemingly consolidated at a high level (single data source, high consolidation score), suffers from significant underlying SQL anti-patterns. All 7 metrics duplicate a complex base data preparation logic (CTEs for date generation and data joins), leading to high maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies. Furthermore, key metrics rely on hardcoded dimension values, which is unscalable given the variety of unique categories and networks. A critical observation is that the 'current period' metrics request data from August 2022, but the live data source (`adex_datasource`) only contains data from January 2023, indicating a potential data availability mismatch and understated results for those periods. The presence of `LIMIT 100` in all metric SQL queries is also an anti-pattern for aggregate measures.",43
6a26c78f-0070-4fb3-88b8-691ee4a4485a,Circ Budget Revenue Weekly Report,high,"The 'Circ Budget Revenue Weekly Report' dashboard, despite its high initial consolidation score, exhibits significant anti-patterns in its metric definitions. While all metrics draw from a single consolidated source table (`v_asl_FCT_finance_os_aggregated`), the SQL logic within individual metrics is highly fragmented due to extensive hardcoding and complex, nested CASE statements. This leads to poor *metric* consolidation, high maintenance overhead, and a significant risk of inaccuracy over time, especially for time-sensitive calculations. The inability to execute live SQL queries (`no_data` status) prevents direct validation of current data behavior, but the observed SQL patterns strongly indicate a need for refactoring.",44
