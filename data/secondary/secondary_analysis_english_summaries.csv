"This dashboard is designed to show how our sales teams are performing, tracking their sales figures, including current results and future bookings. It helps us understand our sales pipeline and overall team effectiveness, specifically for Fiscal Year 2026 (interim period).","This dashboard is a prime candidate for consolidation because it tracks core sales performance, a metric that is often defined and calculated differently across various reports. By consolidating it, we aim to create a single, reliable source for sales data, making it easier to compare performance across different teams and time periods, and to integrate seamlessly with our new finance systems. This process will also address current data display issues, as the dashboard's primary query is not returning data.","During the migration, there might be a temporary period where this specific dashboard is unavailable or shows limited data as we transition to the new, unified system. We will provide alternative reports if necessary. Once migrated, you will have a more accurate, consistent, and reliable view of sales performance, which will improve decision-making.","The main changes will involve a more consistent way of calculating and presenting sales figures, especially for future bookings and forecasts. The underlying data will be cleaner and more reliable, addressing the current issue where the dashboard isn't displaying data. You might see slight differences in historical numbers due to improved data quality and standardized business rules, but these changes will lead to greater accuracy.","You will benefit from a 'single source of truth' for sales performance, leading to more accurate reporting, easier comparisons across teams and time periods, and better overall business decision-making. The new system will be more robust and scalable, ensuring data is always fresh and reliable, and reducing the current governance issues.","We anticipate starting the detailed analysis and design phase in the coming weeks, with development and testing following. Our planned go-live for the consolidated sales performance data and dashboard is targeted for approximately 2-3 months from now. We will provide regular updates on specific milestones and any potential impacts.",1,52c11c9c-052a-4e45-9cda-8fecd87d7964
"This dashboard, 'Circulation Performance Dashboard_dev_20250415', is designed to help our finance team understand how well our products or services are circulating or being adopted. It likely tracks key numbers like sales volume, customer acquisition, or usage rates over time, probably on a weekly basis, to assess business performance and identify trends.","This dashboard is a key candidate for our finance systems consolidation project. Currently, its data and metrics might be isolated or inconsistently defined compared to other finance reports. By consolidating it, we aim to bring its 'circulation performance' data into a single, reliable, and standardized finance data model. This will ensure that 'circulation' metrics are consistent across all finance reporting, making it easier to combine with other financial data like revenue or costs for a complete picture.","During the migration, there might be a temporary period where both the old and new versions of the dashboard are available for comparison. We will aim for minimal disruption. Once migrated, users will access the new, unified dashboard. The primary impact will be on data consistency and reliability, leading to more trustworthy reports. Initial data validation might require users to compare numbers and provide feedback.","The main changes will be behind the scenes: the data sources feeding this dashboard will be unified, and the way key 'circulation' metrics are calculated will be standardized. For users, this means the dashboard will draw from a central, governed finance data model, ensuring consistency with other finance reports. The look and feel might evolve slightly, but the core purpose will remain. The biggest change is the improved reliability and integration of the data.","Users will benefit from more accurate and consistent 'circulation performance' data. This consolidation will eliminate discrepancies between reports, save time spent reconciling numbers, and enable more comprehensive analysis by easily linking circulation data with other financial metrics. Ultimately, it will lead to better, faster, and more confident business decisions based on a single source of truth for finance data.","A precise timeline cannot be given without detailed data analysis. However, given the dashboard's complexity and the number of governance issues, this will be a multi-phase effort. We anticipate a period of data analysis and model design (several weeks), followed by development and testing (several weeks), and finally, a user acceptance testing phase before go-live. We will communicate specific dates as the project progresses, aiming for a smooth transition over the next few months.",3,2104a3f5-9424-4087-a928-e67fecae789a
"This dashboard provides a detailed view of our SuperCoach subscription performance. It tracks how many new subscribers we gain (acquisitions), how many subscriptions are cancelled, and our total active subscriber base. It also allows us to compare our actual performance against our planned budgets and forecasts.","Currently, the way we calculate new SuperCoach subscriptions has some inconsistencies, and our data mixes actual results with future plans, which can be confusing. This consolidation project aims to fix these issues by creating a single, reliable, and clear source for all SuperCoach subscription data. This means we'll have a consistent and accurate way to count new subscribers, and a clear separation between what has actually happened and what we expect to happen in the future.","During the migration, there might be a brief period where the SuperCoach Subscriptions dashboard is unavailable or shows 'in progress' data. After the migration, you will benefit from much more accurate and consistent subscription numbers, especially for new acquisitions. The way we view and compare actuals against forecasts will also be clearer, making your analysis more straightforward.","The main changes you'll see are: 1) A more precise and consistent calculation for new SuperCoach subscribers. 2) A clearer distinction between actual historical data and future forecast/budget data. 3) A standardized way of reporting on our total subscriber base. The underlying data will be cleaner and more reliable, leading to better insights.","This consolidation will provide you with more trustworthy data for critical business decisions, improve consistency across all subscription-related reports, and lay a strong foundation for integrating SuperCoach data seamlessly with other financial systems.

"This dashboard is a detailed financial report that helps us understand how much money we're making and spending, especially related to acquiring new customers (subscriptions and advertising). It breaks down performance by different publications, types of subscriptions, advertising channels, and financial periods.","This dashboard is very complex, with many similar ways of showing the same financial numbers. By bringing all this data together into a single, clear system, we can make sure everyone is looking at the same, accurate numbers. This will reduce confusion, make reports more reliable, and save time currently spent on fixing data issues.","During the migration, there might be a short period where you'll use a new version of this dashboard. Our goal is to make this transition as smooth as possible. Ultimately, you'll get more accurate and consistent financial data, which means better insights and easier decision-making.","You'll notice that some financial terms and calculations will be standardized. For example, instead of many different 'revenue' numbers, there will be one clear 'Gross Revenue' that you can filter by year or source. Also, the way we track customer acquisitions will be much clearer. The underlying data will be much cleaner, especially for understanding where our customers come from.","You'll benefit from more trustworthy data, faster reporting, and less time spent trying to reconcile different numbers. This will lead to clearer insights into our financial performance and customer growth, helping us make smarter business decisions.","We're planning to start this work soon.

By consolidating, we're making sure that the numbers you see here, like revenue and sales, are calculated in the same way across all our finance reports. This will give us a clearer, more consistent view of our financial health.","During the migration, there might be a brief period where this dashboard is unavailable or replaced by a new version. We will provide clear communication on timelines. Once complete, you'll benefit from more accurate, consistent, and faster data, but the initial transition might require you to adapt to a slightly new layout or terminology.","The main changes will be behind the scenes: the data sources and how metrics are calculated will be standardized. You might notice slight changes in how some numbers are presented due to more precise definitions, and the dashboard might load faster. The overall purpose and key insights will remain the same, but with improved reliability.",You'll gain access to more trustworthy and consistent financial data. This means less time spent reconciling numbers from different reports and more confidence in your decisions. It also paves the way for integrating this data with other financial insights in the future.,"The migration for this dashboard is part of the first wave of our finance consolidation project.

"This dashboard is designed to help our finance and marketing teams understand and improve how we manage digital subscriptions. It should show key figures like how many subscribers we have, how many are new, how many are leaving (churn), and the revenue generated from subscriptions. However, it is currently not working and shows no data.","This dashboard is a candidate for consolidation into our new unified finance data model. However, a critical issue has been identified: all data queries for this dashboard are currently returning no results. This means the dashboard is effectively broken and not providing any insights. Before we can even consider consolidating its metrics or data sources, we must first fix this fundamental data availability problem. Once fixed, we can then assess its metrics and integrate them into our standardized financial reporting, contributing to a more consistent and reliable view of our subscription business.","Currently, users of the 'Optimizing Digital Subscriptions Report' dashboard are unable to see any data, making it completely unusable. This means critical insights into our digital subscription performance are unavailable, potentially impacting business decisions related to growth and retention. The immediate impact of this project phase will be to restore data to this dashboard, making it functional again. Only then will we proceed with changes for consolidation, which will involve a temporary period where the dashboard might be updated or replaced with a new, unified version, ensuring long-term data reliability.","The most immediate and important change will be that this dashboard will start displaying data again, as it is currently blank. After this fix, the underlying data sources and how metrics are calculated may be updated to align with our new consolidated finance data model. This will ensure consistency across all financial reports and provide a single source of truth for subscription performance.","Once the data issue is resolved, and the dashboard is successfully consolidated, users will benefit from more reliable, consistent, and accurate subscription data. This will enable better, data-driven decision-making for optimizing digital subscriptions, as the data will be integrated with other financial reports, providing a holistic and unified view of performance.","The first step, which is urgent, is to investigate and fix why this dashboard is showing no data. This is expected to take several weeks of investigation and remediation. Only after data is successfully flowing again can we begin the actual consolidation work, which will involve further analysis, development, and testing. A precise timeline for consolidation will be provided once the data availability issue is fully resolved.",9,5dae02f0-dc48-418c-bdf9-5e5d2b1d6e26

"The 'Contra Report' dashboard is designed to show how much money is being deducted from our total sales, often due to returns, discounts, or other adjustments. It helps us understand the true net revenue after these 'contra' entries. Currently, this report isn't showing any data, which means we can't see these important financial adjustments.","This dashboard is a key financial report, but it's currently broken because it's not pulling any data. Our consolidation effort aims to fix this by moving it to a new, reliable, and unified finance data system.

It's less about merging with other reports and more about getting this one to work correctly and consistently with our new data standards.","During this migration, the 'Contra Report' will be unavailable until the new version is ready. Once migrated, you will have a reliable and accurate report for contra revenue. There might be a short period of adjustment as you get used to the new dashboard's layout and potentially more accurate figures. The biggest impact is moving from a non-functional report to a trustworthy one.","The main change is that this report will start working! It will be powered by a new, centralized finance data system.
