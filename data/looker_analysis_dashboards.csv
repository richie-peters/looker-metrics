There is a high potential for consolidation as multiple queries calculate variations of 'distinct subscription acquisitions' with slight differences in date ranges, rate plans, or source filters. This suggests that a more parameterized or consolidated data model could simplify the underlying queries and improve maintainability.",6,daily,43

There's significant repetition of base filters (e.g., `revenue_transaction_status IN ('Billed', 'Booked')`, `source_publishing_division != 'Medium Rare Content Agency'`) across different queries, and multiple queries calculate variations of 'gross revenue' or list dimensions with slightly different date/advertiser filters. This suggests a high potential for consolidating logic into fewer, more flexible metrics or a unified data view.",6,mixed,44
